## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Make sure the Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib packages are installed on your machine.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The motivation behind this project was to explore temporal trends in the Airbnb data. I seeked to answer the following three questions in my exploration:
- How do the prices of Bostons Airbnbs change throughout the year?
- How about weekly? Can I pick a day of the week to book for cheaper?
- Do we see any significant seasonal change in pricing between Boston and Seattle?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

All of my code used to perform the data engineering and visulization can be found in the 'Boston & Seattle Airbnb Dataset' notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@noahboonin/to-book-or-not-to-book-74146b003c65).
